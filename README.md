**Features**
- [x] Realtime Detection
- [x] Customizable Code
- [x] Can detect more than one faces at once

it can detec multipal faces
When the real-time face identification is true then it detects the face and follows these steps in code: Grab a single frame in real-time video. Convert the image from BGR color (which OpenCV uses) to RGB color (which face_recognition uses) Find all the faces and face encodings in the frame of the real-time video.
